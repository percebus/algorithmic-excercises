"""
You're playing Battleship on a grid of cells with R rows and C columns.
There are 0 or more battleships on the grid, each occupying a single distinct cell.
The cell in the ith row from the top and jth column from the left
either contains a battleship (Gi,j = 1) or doesn't (Gi,j = 0).

You're going to fire a single shot at a random cell in the grid.
You'll choose this cell uniformly at random from the R*C possible cells.
You're interested in the probability that the cell hit by your shot contains a battleship.
Your task is to implement the function getHitProbability(R, C, G) which returns this probability.
Your return value must have an absolute or relative error
of at most 10^ -6 to be considered correct.
