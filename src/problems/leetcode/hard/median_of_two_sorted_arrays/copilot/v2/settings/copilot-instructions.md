A set of instructions that will be added to Copilot requests that generate code. Instructions can come from:

- a file in the workspace: `{ "file": "fileName" }`
- text in natural language: `{ "text": "Use underscore for field names." }`

Note: Keep your instructions short and precise. Poor instructions can degrade Copilot's quality and performance.
