- [ ] `mypy --strict` for all `.py` files
- [ ] Centralize print("âœ…") in `lib`
- [ ] Remove `src.` from all `import`s

### CLI cmds

Move CLI cmds like `pypyr` to `requirements.pipx.txt`

- [ ] `ruff`: `pypyr lint` did NOT work
- [ ] `pylint`: `pypyr lint` did NOT work
- [ ] `pyright`: `pypyr lint` did NOT work
- [ ] etc.

## Done
