## TODOs

- [ ] `mypy --strict` for all `.py` files
- [ ] Centralize print("âœ…") in `lib`
- [ ] Remove `src.` from all `import`s
- [ ] Remove `python` commands from `package.json`.

## Done

- [x] ~~Remove `tests/` from `coverage`~~
- [x] ~~Rename `requirements.min.txt` to `requirements.main.txt`, to hint that it comes from `poetry` `main` dependencies.~~
